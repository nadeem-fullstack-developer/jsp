<h3>About Aadhaar</h3>
The application deals with allowing the citizens to register for a
unique identity. The ID/RFID is supported with a pin. The application
intends to provide secure travel facilities. The travel functionalities
involve passport and license.
<br> The aadhaar server maintains personal profile along with the
photo in a central server at the time of registration. This server then
provides data to concerned departments looking for citizen information.
<br>
<br> Citizen�s being issued passport or those have a passport is
then associated with the UID/RFID. This helps the citizen to travel
abroad without having physical passport. The UID/RFID will provide
access to the passport from the airport for the airline from the
centralized server for verification. The details and profile of the
citizen with the photo can be viewed as part of security check.
<br>
<br> The crime department can also use the application to trace or
stop any person from travelling abroad. The airline gets a notification
when the airport staff has access to the citizen�s passport. The crime
department can stop or trace either using the UID/RFID or passport
number. They could also pass the name of the person and the system can
generate a list of photo previews of people having a passport.
